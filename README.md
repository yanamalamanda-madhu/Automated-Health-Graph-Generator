## Introduction:
It is very difficult to understand the medical reports for normal people who didnâ€™t study MBBS. And 
a specialist is needed to analyse the medical reports and tells about the patient health problem, condition and 
health status of the person, medicine, curation, remedy, solution for the problem, and if need of any changes 
in the food habits that the patient should follow. To derive meaningful insights from voluminous healthcare 
data, it is essential to convert it into machine understandable knowledge. Currently, machine understandable 
domain specific healthcare knowledge curation framework does not exist for complete body of human. By 
these automated systems helps extraction of medical reports data and the data is saved in the machine 
understandable format. The better way to convey the medical health reports is graphs or images. After the 
extraction of medical health data, graph is generated based on the extracted data. The automated graph helps 
in monitoring and recording all the vital information of a particular patient by maintaining all the records. Most 
prior work on information extraction has focused on extracting information from texts in digital documents.
With this automated graph generator, patient data can be extracted, moved, integrated, and accessed seamlessly 
so that the patient is never inconvenienced.
